Flowers hermaphrodite. Perianth regular, the tube sleuder, sepa·
ratinginto 4 se ents from the base or (in two sections) remaining
united, thelim of4 linear laminoe. Anthers all perfect and frea,
sessile at the base of the laminae, usually linear, the connective pro·
duced into a small appendage. No hypogynous scalea. Ovary sessile,
with a single or very rarely 2 collateral ovules, pendulons from near
the apex of the cavity, and orthotropous or slightly amphitropouc. Style
filiform, either dilated and truncate towards the end under a slender
or continuous and firsiform brach, elwa s glabrous below the brush, ·

with acorna of longhairs on the margins or from the base only or also on
one very rarely on both faces-›Shrubs with rigid entire or divided
leaveS, terete cr if flat usually narrow. Flowers usually white or
yellow, in denses ikes or conec, each flower sessile within a bract or
scale; the eones lbbular ovoid oblonor or rarely cylindrical, termiual or
rarely axillary, the receptacle or rhac is woolly and usually cylindricel, ⁶
the scales broad and hardened after flowering, persistent, at least attha
base, and imbricata but not so closely so as in [supremo enin for
the emission of the fruit, the thinner oints of the scales o n fa ing
off after flowering. At the base of the cone are also several imbricata

empty bracts forming an invaluere sometimes larger than the scales

an concealing them, usualgy smaller, persistent or deciduous. In
several species new leaves an shoots form in the axils of the innermost
of these empty bracts, which ultimately fall away, leaving the old eones
sessile in the forks of the branches without empty outer bracts. Nuts
usuall shorter than the scales, the points rarely but the coma fre-
quently protruding.

The genus ie limited to extratropical Australis and is chiefly Weetem. Like the
closely allied Ieopoqon, it differs chiefly from the South African nera of the same
tribe vn the absence of hypogynous scales. The pert of the style eludet is hare termed
the brueh, ie usually considered ae an upper article of the stigma, but I have never
observed any real articulation separating it from the rest of the style, and it deas not
appear to bc ever stigmatic except at the point.
