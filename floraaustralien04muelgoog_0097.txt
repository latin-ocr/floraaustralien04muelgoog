usually omitting stolones. Flowers small, usually numerous, in dense
axillary false-whorls. Bracts within the false-whorls minute, or the
outer ones as long as the calyx.

The genus consiats ol very lew specics, or verlatica, dispersed over the temperate

regions ol the northern hemisphera, the only Australian species scarcely differiag from
some of the northern forms.
