dite tlowers eontracted above the ovary, in the males campanulate, in
the semeles avoid or cylindrical‚ the margin in all dangled or htoothed.

elon ated, a-ribbed, smooth or landular-murioate crownedh the

The species ara numerous in tro ical and subtrepical America, bnt there are also a
lew in southern Asia and in the island region from the S. African coast to the Pacifio.
Ol the three Australian species one is widel spread over the tropical regions both ol
the New and the Old World, another extends tc Nortollr Island and Now Zealand, and
possibly to some ol the islanda ol the Eastern Archipelago and South Pacific, the third
may be eudemio, bnt closely resembles if it be not identical with a Paoific island spe·
cies, the synonym , however, notwithstanding the reeearohes of Seemann, remains ex·

agedingly confused and the specimens now m our herbaria are wholly insufficient to
