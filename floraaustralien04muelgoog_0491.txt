Flovvers hermaphrodite. Perianth irregular or rarely regular, tbo'
tube revolute or curved under the limb or rarely straight, the limb
globular or rarely ovoid, often oblique, the laminae often coheriug long
after the tube has opened. Anthers all perfect, sessile in thebasa of
the concave laminae, the connective not produced beyond the cells.
Hypogynous glande united in a single semiannular or semicircular
rarely dish-sbnped gland occupying the upper side of the torus, in some
species very 1111111. Ovary stipitate but usually very shortly se, with 2
amphitropous ovules laterally attached about the middle; style either
long and protruding from the slit of the periantb before tbe summit is
set free from the limb asin Greoillaa, or not exceeding the periantb, more
or less dilated at the end into a straight or oblique or lateral cone or
disk, bearing the small stigma in the eentre of the disk cr et- thc summit
of the eone. Fruit a hard usuall woody capsule openin 1112111111.
Seeds 2, compressed and collateral, the testa produced at 1111 upper end
into a broad membraneus wing. usually lo (rer than tbe nuc eus and
more or less decurrent down the upper or bot margins and sometimes
completely surrounding tbe nucleus, the nucleus itself flat and smooth
on t e inner face (next the other seed), convex on the outer face and
usually rugose or muricate, the rotuberances fitting into corresponding
cavities in the valve; each seed with its ving sometimes covering the
whole inner surface of tbe valve, more frequently placed near the upper
margin and covering about half only or rather more, the remainder of
the valve a hard woody masa-Shrubs or rarely small trees. Iaeaves
alternate, very diversified in shape, flat or terete, the mareins rarel
recurved and the two surfaces usually similar and equally veined
Flowers in pairs along the thaebis of a short and dense raceme or cluster
or rarely in a longer racemo, the clusters or racemos sessile in tbe axils
or rcrely also terminal or in every few species all terminal. Indumentum
