Mr. Wnlcott’s ‘Dictiounry oi Sacred Arehoeology’ is designcd to satisfy a great
aud growing want in the literature oi tha dep. The iucreesed interest talsen bp
large classes oi the commuuity in the Ecclesiasticsl History, the Archmology, the
Ritual, Artistic, and Conventual Uaagca ot the early and middle agea of Ohristen-
dom hes not been met by the publication oi manuale at all dtted by their com·
prehensireness. their accamy, and the convenience oi their arrangement tc ,
supply this highly importent demand. 'I'o combine in one the rerird and general
information required by the cultivated rmder et large with the higber and more
special sources of knowledge ol which the student ol ecclesiastiord lore has need,
is tho object which has been kept in view in the compilation now offered to the
publio. In no work ol the kind has the English public, it is confidently believed,
had presented to it so large and varied n mass ot matter in a form so conveniently
arranged ior reference. One valuablc feature to which attention may hc inrited
is the oopious list ot authorities prefixed to Mr. Waloott's Dietionary. The
student will here find himself put readily upon the track ior following up any
particular line ol inquiry‚ oi which the Dictionary has giren him the first outlince.
