Flowers in sessile or nearly sessile clusters surrounded by several very
deciduous imbricate bracts.

The genus extends over tropical Asia. Of the two Australian species one is a
common Indian one, the other appears to be endemic.

More or less ferrugineusvillous, at least the young shoota and intio
