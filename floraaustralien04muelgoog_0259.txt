1. A. nodlssora, R. Br. Prod. 417. Stems prostrate, decumbent or
ascending, 6 in. to 1 or even 2 ft. long, glabrous or slightly pubescant
in decurrent lines. Leaves linear or lanceolata, shortly contracted at
the base, l to 2 in. long. Spikesglobular‚ about 4 lines diameter when
fully out, but often clustered many together into dense globular messes
sometimes above 1 in. diameter, interspersed with a few small floral
leaves. Bracta bracteolas and ›orientii-segmenta narrow, acuminata
with fine points, usually about ll lines long or rather more. Stamene

Australians oimens when first in flower are very much h e those ol A. denticulata.
When fully ddvelopod the periantha and bracts are much longer arrd more acuminatos,
the fruit ehorter rn proportion and broader than in A. deutheriam, and the notch,
although variable, usually much deeper.

2. Α. denticulata, R. Br. Prod. 417. Stems prostrate, oreeping
and rooting at the lower nodes, often extending to 2 or 3ft. and shortly
aseending, glabrons or minutely pubescent in decurrent lines, Leaves
linear or linear-lanceolate, obtuse or mucronato, shortly eontraeted at
the base, mostly ff to ll in. long. Spikes globular or at length ovoid
or oblong, about plin. diameter, closely sessile in the axile aud some·

usually quite labrous. Perianth-segments under] line long, very
