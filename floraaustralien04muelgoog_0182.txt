Although allied 1011. palrtdore, thie species appears to be sufficiently distinct iu

foliage and inflorescence aud pmb⁸b¹i in stature, as well as in the quite sessile fruiting
perianth. Moquin describes tlre 10 vee aa elliptioal, but it is evideut that iu the
specimens he saw, aa in all Drummoud's, they were not yet fully formed.
