perisnth about 1 line long, the segmenta usually 4, rather broad but
unequal, erect, acute. Fruit about as long as the perianth, tubercular·
rugosa, the ricsrp very thin and scarcely separable from the seed.

Flowers hermaphrodite. Perianth with a short turbinata hard tube,
reduced sometimes to a slight expansion of the eduncle3 segmenta ὁ,
011 equal or the three inner ones rather smaller,linear, rigid, usually 3-
ribbed at the base, scarious attha tipp or also along the margins ot' the

celled) hairs giving them a plumose appearance, the short tips alone
glabrous. Stamens normslly 5, but usually 1, 2, or3 of them small
and without anthera, or entirely abortire, and all the filaments unequal,
armore rarely all equal and antheriferous, united at the base in a mem-
branous cup adnate to the parinum-tube or shortly free hom it, without
or rarely with intervening scale-like teeth or lobes, which, when present,
are very thin and transparent; anthers 2·celled. Ovary uniovulate.
Style simple, rigrd, with a small capitote stigma. Fruit an indehiscent
“ utricle, usually obovoid'or contracted into a stipes at the base and
obli ue at the to ,with the ersistent style more or less excentrical.
Seed vertical- erbs underslrrubs or rarely shrubs‚ labrous or hairy
with crisped articulate woolly or stellate hairs. 100000 alternate,
narrow or rarely obovate. Flowers in dense globular avoid or cylindri·
cal spikes‚ver rarelyelon ted and interrupted. Bracts and bracteolas
scarious and shining, nervelbss or with a more or less prominent mid·
rib produced into a fine or short point. Perianths usually pink or

straw-colour. Stamene and ovary often enveloped in dense wool or ι

long hairs proceeding either from the lower part or clnws 01 11ιο inner
penanth·segments or from the outside of the staminnl cups.

'l'he genus is limited to Australis, for the opposite-leaved T. Zeyberi from S. Africa,
admitted by Moquin, must be referred 10 Serrcccoma, the presence or absence of scales
between the stameus being by no means of absolute geneda importance.

This and the following genus have been united by Poiret and F. Mueller under the
name of Ptilotae, by S rengel nuder that of 7110110100, and they might perhaps be
really better 0000110το 00 sections 01 000 genus than us two distinct oucs, were it not
for the useless confusion which would result in the nomenclatura 01 species. At
any rate, 11110 00100 10 adopted it would 10 better to followS rengrl in preferrin tlte
name of Triclinium for the united genus, 00 being that whicfi belongs to four-filths of
the species, end entails therefore tho least change, besides that it is the most fanriliar
of the two from the number of species that have been cultivated or tigmed. Neither
name has the right 01 priority‚ both being of the same dato, ond both ore c ually
apposite for tlte ups they designate, and epnally inappropriate fur tho com iued
species, for T· iciam means “a clothingo hairs‚'’ eletas “having featherless
wlllllhe subdivisiones the genus I have been unable to establish any natural well·
