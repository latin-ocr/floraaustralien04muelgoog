line long below the horizontal win s, with 3 or rarely 4 very prominent
vertical wings, and more than 1101101 11 00011311οἀ11 e thicktsolid base

below the fruit, the upper part of 1110 perian wi in the wings flat

and closing over the fruit as in most Koolias, the horizontal wings
united in a single rigidly membraneus ring expanding to 4 or 5 lines
