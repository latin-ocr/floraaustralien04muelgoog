Formerly associated with Inoompns, on grounds which now a pear quite unintelli-
gible, in a distinct order, Hernorsdichas been nn isolatcd, and Ι hod thought, from the

characters given, that it hed been related to Euplsorhs'occoe. The examinationes the
florvers, however, at once shows the correctness oi the mors recent views placing it in
close connection with Larrrinase, with which Order hleissner was unwilling actually to
unite it on account os the dehiscenca ol tha arithers. 'l'he difference is, however, in
this respect bnt rer small. 'l'he shnpe os tha alamans, their hasal glande, the innata
antherrclls closed hy decidnous volves, are preciscly the same. the only distinction
hein that in Laurinera generally the vnlres are detnched from the base npwards, and
in emicedia irem the inner tn the enter side. Another differcnce consisto in the inle-
rior every, the anerith-tubo being from tha first adnoto, whilst in Loorineoe it only
becomes so as tlle lruit enlargcs (eg. in C'vyptocarya and in Coasytho) or ramains quite
free. On the whole, therclhrc, it appears to me that Heroondia and the closely allied
if not congencr Hernonda'opss's she nee placed nse Suborder ol lranrineaa, separated hy
characters cl scarcely moro importance than those which distinguish Coasytlra.
