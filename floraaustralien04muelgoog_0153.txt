Van? parav'jlora. Smallcr in all its porta than P. uaria, but otherwise closely re·
cambling thet ical form with uarrow leaves and hirsute flowers. S ikes cylindrical,
rather dense or cose, lto l in. longor rather rnore. Sepals rather adhue 1 linc long
the op ue contre usually hirsute. (lapaule with a conical end exceeding the calyx aad
longer t an in other venetias ol this species-N. S. Wclee aud more frequently ιιι Vic-
toria, also Kangaroo island. R. Brauon-Perhaps a distinct species and in some measure
connecting P. varia with P. debilia.

lt is vary possible that the study ol the different forma thus included in P. varia on
the lirin planta by local botauiets, who would bestow on them tha time and patience
that baalam devoted to Europaeo Rati, Batracht'on Raounculv', dac, might point out
several permanent races, oi which dried specimeos without indication ol' the circom-
atances oi their growth give no indication.

i. 303. Stock usually woolly-hairy at the haee of the leaves. Leaves
radical, broadly lanceolata or ovate-lanceolata, acute, entire, with
broad petioles‚ villoue on both sides like the villone cimene of P.
tmnmoica, but usually larger. Spikes dense and cyliridlical although
narrower than in P. taomoieo, ll⁰ above 1 in. long, the huda very
closely imbricate in several rows. Bracts and sepale quite glabrous or
rarely with asevv marginal cilia. Δ

lhave seen but very lew specimus, and with J. D. Hooker do not leel certain ol'
their correct identification with Verreaux's Tasmanian plaut described by Decaisno.
The flowere are amaller aud the spikes more denae than in P. uaria, the foliage is nearer
that oi P. tarmaaica, and it appears to ditl'er from both in the close imbrication ol the
buda before expanding.

i. 303. A small alpine species. Leaves radical, rosulate, oblong or

lanceolate, contracted into a short petiole, entire or ras-ely coarsely
mooted, usually of a thick consisteuce, from densely hoary· irsute on

both sides to quite glabroue. Scapes short, rarely attaining 6 in., with
a dense ovoid oblong or cylindrical spike, rarely ff in. lon , and some-
times reduced to 2 or 3flowers, glabrous or intermixed with afew hairs.
Sepals glabroue, about l line long, with less of the acaricus margin than
in P. varia. Corolla-lohes narrower than in that species and more

acute. Ovary Q-colled with two collateral ovules in eac cell.-Dcne. in
