stout shrub of 6 to 8 ft, the young branchos ferrugineus-pubescent or
yilloua tlie foliage glabrous. Leaves mostly oblongcuneate, but vary-
mg from oblong-linear to almost uberate, obtuse or with a small callous
point, tapering into a short petiole, 2 to 3 or rarely 4 iii. long, thick,
the veiiis often impressed above and scarcely cons icuous underneath,
the margins of'ten recurved. Racemes short aad dense, about ein.

inner ones lin. long, the outer ones sliorter, more acuminate and some-
times irith lierbaceous tips. Pedicels glabrous‚ about l iii. long. Pe-
riantli under 1 in. long, the broad part shorter in proportion than in
Τ. speciosissima, ta ering into a recurved neck ut least as long. Pruit

Flowers hermaphrodite. Perianth irregular‚ the tube oblique, open
along the lower side, tapering at the to , the limb ovoidglobulsr, re-
curved, the laminae long cohoring. Antliers ovate, sessile iii the con·
eave lumime. Hypogynous glands 3, broad and truncate, the fourth
upper one deficient. Ovary on along stipes, tapering into a longs le
dilated at the top into a flat oblique disk stirmatic in the centre; ovu es
several, laterally attached below the middle, amphitropous, imbricate
upwards in 2 rows. Folliole coriaceouS‚ opening almost flat. Seeds
imbricate upivardS, with a broad terminal nearly straight iring, sur-
rounded by tlie marginal rapha—Sliriibs or trees. Leaves alternate,
entire, toothed or pinnately (livided, very variable on the sanie indi-
vidual. Floivers pedicellato in pairs, in terminal or axillary simple or
slightly branched racemes. Braets under each pair usually small
narrow and very deciduous or often entirely wanting. Perianths white
or pale yelloiv‚ sometimes assuming at length a reddish tint.

ittle for their distinction besides thu foliage which is emiiiently variable. The thiu
fragile pellicle or powdery substance iuter osed between the sceda in this genus and in

Pelopea, appears to be 00 epidermal pr uction ol tlie seed itself, but its real nature
can scarcely be ascertained without obscriiug it iu a fresh state both before aad aster
