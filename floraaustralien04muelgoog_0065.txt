pltoino, with the same close white indumentum, and perha s a variety or
even a different state only of the same species, but onl ltnown from a
small fragment, showing looser oymes with very small oblon iloral
leaves and smaller flowers, the calyx rather more deeply divided into
oblong·spathulate or almost obovate lobes. The structure of the
flowers appears to be the same as that of P. neptuim-calomen
