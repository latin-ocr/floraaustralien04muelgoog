e. incana. Pubeseence short and more or less hoary, giving tha plant the aspect ol
H. incana, bnt with the calyx ol Η. pauperia. Corolia small, minutely pubescent-

lt is possible that the observation oi ilowers iu the recent stote may supply characters
to distinguish amongst the above atleast two more definite varieties or s cies, but in
the great majority ol dried specimeus the corollas are too much injure to uncertain
their precise lorm and size.
