Oanaa CIII. LAURINEAE.

Perianth regular, the tube very short or none at the time oi flower·
ing, sometimes enlarged over or under the fruit, or rarely adnate to the
ovar and fruit ; segmenta 6 or rarely fewer, all equal or 3 outer ones
smaller, imbricata in the bud. Stamene normally twice as many as
periauth-segments,6 opposite them with introrse anthera, 6 within and
opposite to the outer ones with the anthera extrorse in some genera, in·
trorse in others, but in many genera 3 or sometimes all oi' the inner

stamens, and in others 3 or al of the outer ones reduced to short sta·
minodia or wanting, and in some flowers the stamens abnormally and
irregularly increased or diminished iu number; there are also frequently
a pair of sessile or stipitate rather large glands, one on each side of the
filament eit-her oi' the inner or rarely of the outer oi' the two stamens
opposed to the inner perianth-segrnents 3 anthera adnate, with 2 col·
lateral cells or 2 superposed pairs of cells, each cell opening in a valve
from the base upwards or in Herminius from the inner to the outer side.
Ovary free, or in Hermadm adnate, consisting of asingle car el with
one ovulc suspended from the apex of the cavity from a funicdl adnate Ἴ
to its side, or rarely with a second small abortire ovule. Style simple,
often very short, witha capitate dish-shaped or obliquely dilated stigma,
entire or shortly and irregularly lobed. Fruit a berry or drupe, rarely
dry or nearly so, the perianth entirely deciduous‚ or the tube enlarged
anddisk·shaped or cup-slraped under the fruit or more or less succulent
and closing over it or adnate to it. Seed pendulous, with a membra-
nous or (in Herncrtdic) a hard testa, without albumen. Embryo with
thick fleshy cotyledone fillin the seed, enclosing the plumula and short
superior radiole-'lrees or alirnbs with alternate or rarely irregularly
opposite leaves, more or less glandular·dotted and aromatic (except in
Harmodio) usually entire and evergreen, or, in Oassythc, leafless parasi-
tical twinera. Stipules none. Flowers usually small, iu cymes reduced
sometimes to clusters umbels or heads, the cymes solitary or arranged
in racemos, clustera, or penicles, or, in Ocasythc, the flowera singly ar-
ranged in spikes or raoemes.
