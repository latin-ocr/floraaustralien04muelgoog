01 these three supposed species are the almost siu *le aud very rrnsarissaetory ones in
Browu's Herbarium, with scarcely any ssowers. 'lhey are all from the same locality,
aad the differences between rhem appear ta me to be very slight, no more than what we
coustanrly observe between different sperimeus as other species ln Rflan'salr'a the
leaves are rather smaller aud 1101101101 than in P. scabra, and thera are i'ewer heire on
the perianth; iu P. a athulata the leaves ere rather larger aud broader, vaith similar
slightly bairy perianths. All three agree in the habit aad other characters which dis·
tinguish rhem from any that I have seen in other collectiores. Meissner places 1110111 in
