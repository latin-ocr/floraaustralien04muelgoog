contrical carpel, or of several carpels either distinct or united in a ring
round the centre of the torus or, in a genus not Australien‚ forming a
single l·celled ovary with the ovules in a ring round a central column.
Ovules solitary in each carpel, ascending, amphitropous or anstropous.
Styles as many as carpels, proceeding from their upper inner angle,
free or united at the base, sti atie along their inner edge. Carpels
of the fruit variously enlarge ‚ free or united, dry or succulent, inde·
hiscent or dehiscent along their inner or entered e or both. Ssed
ascending‚ sometimes accompanied by a small suillus or strophiole3
testa membraneus or crustaceous. Al umen mealy or somewhat fleshy,
copious, scanty, or sometimes none. Embryo usually much curved,
rarel folded or straight3 cotyledone narrow or broad and convolute3
radicle inferior-Herbe, undershrubs, or rarely shrubs or trees, usually
glabrous. Leaves alternate, usually entire. Flowcrs hermaphrodite
or unisexusl, in terminal axillary cr leaf-opposed spikes racemos or
{lipsters purely solitary, usually accompanied bya subtendiug bract and
raoteoes.

The Order is chiefly American aud African, a very few species extending into Asia,
as weeds os cultivation or otherwise introduced. The Australien genem are cll eudemio,
one ol them nearly allied to, but quite distinct from, on American genus, the others
belonginp to a series (or genus in on extendcd sense) exclusively Australiau. All heve
unisoxus flowers, whilst those ol the American and African genera cre, with the excep
tion of s single species, hermaphrodite.
