The genus dhuoda was founded mainly upon the absence oi the anthat-appendages,
the degree os development os which is very differentia different species of Prostuotlvero,·
they are uite obsoleta also in some species of the section Klanden'u, and scarcely dis-
tinguishalle in some other Prostaotlverae, where the are completely aduste ιο the back
rell. The second character, tlre transverse rib inuida the calyx, appears to be uo more
than the transverse pubescant nine ol the tvro preceding species, rather narrower and
more raised in this oue, but quite disconnected with the venation oi the calyx.
