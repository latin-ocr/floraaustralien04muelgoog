1. 10010010, R. Br. Prod. 418. Erect and probably 211. high or
more, the upper flowering portion with spreading opposite dichotomous
branchos, the whole plant more or less pubescent with soft appressed
bairs. Leaves elliptical-oblong or almost lanceolata, mostly acute, con·
tracted into a short petiole, those anthe main stem and the lower floral
ones 1 to 3 in. long, the upper floral ones very small. Flowers in deuse
clusters or short spikes sessile in the u per axils and forks of the penicle,
each flower sessile within a spinesoentbract shortly dilated andscarious
at the base, and 3 similar but smaller bracteoles very divaricata on the
fruiting perianth. Perianth with 2 outer segments about 13 lines long
hut unequal, hairy, 10110001οῖ0, tapering into a rivid spinesoent point,
with 2 or3 more or less conspicuous nerves on eac side of the promi·
nent midrib, the 2 inner ones smaller glabrous and scarcely nerved,
Stamene 4, the filaments short, the intervening scales or staminodia
broad, truncate, about half as long as the filaments. Fruit nearly

globular, about ff line long, membraneus exce t the depressed summrt
which is harder.-Moq. in Dc. Prod. xiii. ii. 309.

Ihave seen bnt few specimens. The perianths are usually but not always more
thichencd at the base aud reflexed than iu N. diffusa. The spinesoent bracts and
summits of the periauth-segments are very varioble iu length and relative pro rtions,
but thoy are usually, especially the bracteolas, shorter than iu N. dissuas. edif-
ference in thc stamcns appears to be constant.

2. Ν. diffusa, 010.Ροοο 418. An annual or biennial 010001 allied
to N. erecta, but usually more branched from the base, more slender,
‚and the parts smaller. Stenas attaining 1 to 3 h, the greater portion
consisting of a broad leafy panicle‚ the branchos dichotomous or the
lower ones trichotomous Leaves ovate or oblong, obtuse or acute,
rarely much above l in. and mostly small. Spikes orclusters of flowers
very short, in the axils and in the forks of the panicio, the flowers
, usually smaller than in N. erecto, but the segmenta 00 well 00 the bracts
end bracteolas even more variable in siae and relative proportione than
in that species; sometimes 011 three bracts are subulate almost from the
base and 3 to 4 lines lontr, more frequently the bracteolas are much
shorter, but all three very 'varicate; one of the outcr perianthseg-
ments usually long, the other much shorter, both spinesoent, the inner
ones lanceolata and ta ering into 0 shorter spine. Stamens always2
only, with short broa truncate scales or staminodia between them.-
