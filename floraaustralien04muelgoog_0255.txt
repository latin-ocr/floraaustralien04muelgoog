9. Ρ. villoslflorus, F. 111111. thrym. iii. 125. A small slender
annual with erect or decumbant branches not above 3 in. high in the
single specimen known, the brenches loosely woolly. Leaves small,
linear or lanceolam, obtuse, contracted into along petiole, glabrous or
slightly woolly. Spilres globular, numerous end sessile or nearly so es
in P. meretricata, ut only 1 in. diameter. Brects and bracteoles es
long as the pertarith, and perienth-segments with long sillry-wooll
hoirs on the lower half with the upper half or lamine glabrous, all
entirely as in P. veteratricem but scarcely above half the size.

branching at chenese, with several prostrate slender stems, usuelly
simple 1111211411. long, but sometimes ascending slightl branched
and attaining at least 6 11. Leavcs linear or linear-spathulas, obtuse
or the upper ones memorate-acute, mostly about 1 11. long besides the
petiole, which is long in some specimens‚ very short in othere. Spilres
nt first ovate, at length oblong, attaining fully 1 in. in length and about
l in. diameter, the control one usually sessile at the base of the sterne,
the others termine] and sessile within the lest leaves of the stems or
their brenches. Brects very thin and transparent, broadly ovate or or*-
bicular, nearly as long es the perianth. Perianth 2} to nearly 3 lines
long, the very short entire base or disk surrounded by e dense tuft of
long articulate heire sometimes es long es the perienth; segmenta
