robust shrub, sometimes low and procumbant, sometimes ereat bushy
aad attaining 3 οι· 4 ft, the branches nearly glabrous, with few narrow ,
scales attha base of each year's shoot. Leaves very narrow, often 6 to
8 in. long, with closely revoluto margins, tomentose underneath, rarely
all entire, frequently toothed towards the end or in the u per half only,
or in the typical forms regularly divided for more than liulf the length
or quite to the base into short recurved lobes or teeth. Plenas-heads
large, lateral without any or with very few small linear floral leaves.
Involueres at first avoid, at lenoth ver broad, blacls and glabrous or
when young sli htly woolly, fl to dy in. long; enter bracts broad,
sometimes with ebert subulate points, inner ones broadly linear, obtuse.
Perianths not exceeding the involucre, villone above the glabrons face,

abessent or glabrous towards the end, the limb very narrow, 3 lines

not thickeued stigmatis end. Capsule above t in. broad. Seeds (in
the fruit examined perhaps not' quite ripe) entirely separatis without
leaving any intermediate plats, the wing very thin though drmed of
