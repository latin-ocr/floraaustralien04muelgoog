Leaves oblong·linear spathulate or rarely almost obovute, obtuse with
a small point or acute, narrowed at the base, 1 to 2 in. long, pubescent
when young, at length glabrous or nearly so. Pedicels 3 to 4 lines
long, creet or recurved, axillar or forming terminal or subterminal
racemos by the reduction of the tloral leaves to small braets. Perianth
villone, 4 to 5 lines long, the segments without points. Anther-con·

Ido not seel very confident in having properly distinguished this species from P.
sericeo. Possibly some os tlte namon-leaved sper-imaus wlrielrl have referred to the
latter may belong rather to P. Mtclaellis] or P. Mteteosi itsels may be only a variety ol
P. sericeo. 'l'he series ol specimens is not complete enough to determine these points.

31. P. fastigiata, R. Br. Prot. Noc. 13. A shruh with rather
alender branchos shortly pubescent. Leaves rather crowded, incurved,
narrow-linear, scarcely acute, attenuate at the base, the margins re·
