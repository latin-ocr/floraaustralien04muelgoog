contracted into a rather long petiole, l to l in. long. Spikes nearly

lobular, about l in. diameter, ou short axillary peduncles or flowering
branchlets, usually with a few small leaves close under the spike. Bracts
and bracteolas very acute and mucronato, about 3 lines long, very thin
but the outer ones rather brown with prominent midribs. Perianth
about 6 lines long, the short tube shortly hirsute, the segmenta narrow,
plumosa outside with long fine hairs, with short glabrous pinlr huucate
or denticulato ti s, the iuner segmenta smaller with narrower tips and
with a few woolly hairs inside at the base. Filaments ὃ, unaqual 'aad
some without anthers, but all dilated towards the base and united ιιι a
short cup. Ovary glabrous3 style quite lateral.

26. T. sertatum, Moq. ia Heri. Hooh. A glabrous undershrub, with
rather slender but rigidly divaricata striate branchos. Leaves few and
distant, sessile or nearly so, linear, im Ξ in. long or the npper ones

smaller. Spikes at first hemispherica but at len th somewhat elongated
all pedunculate forming aloose irregular leaiy paniole. Bracts and
bracteoles obtuse, rather broad, closely envelopiug the perianth, scarious
and shining without prominent midribs, about 2 lines long. Perianth
abouto lines long, very deciduous leaving the bracts ersisteut, the
segmenta free almost from the base, narrow and rigid, pfhmose almost

“ to the tips with long fine soft hairs, the outer ones often rather longer

than the inner with more prominent ti a, all glabrous inside. Staminal
cup very short, surrounded by very dense long and intricate woolly
hairs proceeding mostly from the cup itself3 filaments uaequal, the
longer ones dilated downwards. Ovary glabrous3 style excentrical.

Drummond's rpecimens wera afterwards referred by Mo uin to Τ. divaricatum, to
which they bear some resemblance, but from which they nider iu a much looser divari-
cata pariclo, the flowers amabar, the porinum-segmenta free to the base, and the wool
surrounding the stamens proceeding from the staminal cup and not from the luner-
segmenta.
