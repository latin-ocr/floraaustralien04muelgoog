An undershrub with lon ereot slightl branched stema attaining 3 or
cit, the lower part of the stem and leaves usually loosely tomentose

and more or less floccose, the upper part of the stem and sometimes the
whole plant except the inflorescence and calyxes quite glabrous.
beares oposite or in whorls of three, oval·oblong or lanceolate,
obtuse,o n irregularly crenate, contracted at the base, mostly ἢ to

entirely wanting. Flowers small whitish, in dichotomous cymes
sometimes pedunculate and many-dovered, sometimes condensed into

sessile opposite heads in distant pairs formin alon interrupted
