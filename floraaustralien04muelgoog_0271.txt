Β. Australis. Barker town, F. Mueller.

Common in Europe aud temperate Asia. and now naturalized in many other arts oi

have tubercles on all three inner perianth-segments. hlore northern specimeus hare
them frequently only on one segment ol each perianth,

2. R. conglomeratus, Murr.; Meister. iu DC. Prod. xiv. 49. An
erect perennial of 2 or 3 ft. more branched than R. crispae. Radical
