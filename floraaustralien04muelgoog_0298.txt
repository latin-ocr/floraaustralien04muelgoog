290 011. uoururaema. [Koara.

Female perianth similar to the male, bnt twice the siae, with a more
minute orifice, and circumsciss aster flowerin ‚ neither male nor female
with any inflexed point or scale within the lobes. Carpels above 39,
hispid, with short glabrous stigmatic styleS, connivent and almost
coherent at the tips. Drupes nearly globular or shortly ovoid, nearly
l in. ἔζης, distinotly stipitute on the expanded disk or base of tho
perian .

4. Κ. pubescens, Beata A tree, the branchos inflorescenoe and
young foliage more or less pubescent, the older leaves often glabrous
or nearly so. Leaves from broadly ovate-elliptical to oblong·lanceolate
obtuse or shortly and obtusely acuminato, shortly and rigidly toothed
or nearly entire, rounded at the base, becoming at length coriaceous
with the veins prominent underneath 2 to 4 in. long, on petiolas of ξ
to l in. Flowers in small cymes or c usters sometimes lengthened into
short thyrsoid penicles, which are sessile or pedunculate, but usually
scarcely ff solongasthe leaves. Pedicels 2 to 3 lines long. Bracts
adnue to the perianth. Perianth about l line diameter, nearly globular,
the orifice closed with4 small lobes, thin in the males, thickened insido
in the semeles. Stamens 4 opposite to the erianth lobes, the filamenta
shortl free and distinct, with l or 2 smdler stamens within them.

Fem e perianth circumsciss. Carpels numerous, villous, with thick
fflrous nearly sessile sti as. Drupes closely sessile on the dilated

l' or buseo the periant , ovoid, glabrous or nearly so, 3 to 4 lines

6. HEDYGABYA, Forst.

Flowers dioecious. Perianth hemispherical or flat, with about 8 (7
to 10) small inflexed lobes. Stameus in the mules numerous, covering
the whole disk or leaving a small villous contre, without rudimentary
carpels; anthers sessile or nearly so, the cells usually lateral, distinct,
opening longitudinally. Oarpels in the females numerous, sessile, oc·
cupying the whole disk without staminodia, with one eudulous ovule
in each, and terminating in a short thick obtuse style. ruitin carpels
drupaceous, small numerous crowded and almost coherent int e Aus-
tralran species, larger fewer and distinct (as in llollinedm and Kibara) in
other cies. Seed with afleshy albumen. Embryo small, with erect
cotyledlha-Trees or shrubs. Leuves toothed or entire. Flowers in
short axillary cymes or raceme-like penicles. Bracts small or none.

another from the islanda ο the S. Pacihc. 'l'he above-described Molliacdia? acami-
