ovules‚ or 2 or 3 superposed pairs of collateral ovules in each cell, at-
tached to the ineurved margins of a placenta projecting from the dissepiss
ment so as to divide each cell more or less perfectly into 2, with one of
the ovules of each air in each half-cell, or sometimes the ovary divided
from the first into 2 to 4, or in extra-Australian species more, cells with
one ovule in ench cell. Ovules pendulous, anatropous, with a superior
