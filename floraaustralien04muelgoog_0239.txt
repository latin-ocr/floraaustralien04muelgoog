the lower ones contracted into a petiole, the eater part of the stem
bearing onlyafew scarious scales or very smallldaves. S ilres lobular
or at length ovoid‚ about 11 10. diameter, much resembling t ose of
Τ. Manylesir‘ but smaller and the pink glabrous tips not so long. Bracts
and bracteoles ovate, very scarious, slightly mucronata, with the midrib
prominent, 3 to 4 lines lone, the outer ones not so brown in the centra
as in Τ. Manylcsii. Perianth about 1 in. long, the tube scarcely 1 1100,
the segments nearly equal, the dorsal hairs not so longas in Υ. 1100919111,
and the glabrous tips scarcely 1 line, the inner segments with lonor woolly
hairs outside near the base. Filaments shortly dilated at the base but
scarcely united above the perianthtube, 1 or two short and without
anthers. Ovsrnglabrous3 style with a few long spreading baira.-

Ι. Aemus. Scrnb near Spencar¹s Gall, Wdlrelms', Warhartoa. Very near
T. Manylesii, but besides the difference in foliage the flowers are smaller with less pro·
minent tips and tho stylos bairy.

17. Τ. gomphrenoides‚ Moq. iu DC. Prod. xiii. ii. 287. A peren·
nial with a tufted stock and erect simple stems ofl to 11 lb, glabrous
or sprinlded upwards with a few short hairs. Radical leaves oblong-
spat ulate, obtuse or mucronate,l 101110. long, contracted into a

long petiole3 stem-leaves few small and distant, sessile, linear or

lanceo ate, very acute. Spihes solitary, at first globular‚ more ovoid
when fully out, about 1 10. diameter or rather more. Bracts brown
with scarions margins lanceolata or almost ovate, very acute,
several em tv ones often crowded at the base of the spike; bracteoles
as long and equally acute, but broader aud the midrib alone hrown.
Perianth about 1 10. long, the turbinata tube about 1 1100, the segments
plumose with fine hairS,'the outer ones rather broad, scarcely ribhed,
with obtuse glabrous tips, the iuner ones smaller, with acute tips and
woolly hairs inside below the middle. Staminal cup very short, fres
from the perianth-tube3 filaments short, uaequal, the larger ones much
dilated at the base, oue very short without any anther. Ovary abghtly
hirsute. Style excentrical.

18. ¹1¹. aquamanus, Bmth. A glabrons perennial, with the branch-
ingstock, the erect simple ri 'd stema of 1 to 2 ft, aud the linear
mucronata acute small distant eavea of Τ. Dramrwrdii, but without the
lobes of the staminal cup of that species. Radical leaves not persistent
at the time of llowering as 10 Τ. pomparenoides. Spikes globular or
ovoid, rather above 1 in. diameter. Bracts and bracteoles ovate, mu-
