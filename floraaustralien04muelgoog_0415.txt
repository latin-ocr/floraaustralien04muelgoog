Flowers hermaphrodite. Perianthregular or nearly so, the tube
elonffiated, often dilatedupwardsandslrghtly1ncurved,thelobesnarrow,

s ir yrevolute, the two lower ones sometimes more deepl separated.
dathus all perfect, inserted ou the lobes and revolute with them, the
connective shortly produced beyond the cells. Hypogynous scales
either ilat at least as long as the ovary and free or connata, or in one
species wanting. Ovary very small, densely covered with long hairs,
with 2 pendulous ovules. Style filiiorm sometimes slightly thrckened
and grooved on a level with the anthers; stigma small, termina] or
shortly decurrent on the up rside. Fruit a short hard truncate sessile
follicle, the lower (dorsalie margin reduced into a thick horn,
and osten ahorn also on the upper angle of each valve. Seeds where
known flat, borderedb anarrow margin-Shrnbs. Loaves mostly in
whorls of 3, rarely of , or sometimes scattered at the base of luxrurant
shoots, entire or with spinescent teeth. Flowers red or yellow, usually
long, solitary or 7 together sessile within an inuoluere ol imbricata co·
loured bracts ς the inner bracts long and narrow the outer ones short and
broad, the involucres sessile and termiual or axillary.
