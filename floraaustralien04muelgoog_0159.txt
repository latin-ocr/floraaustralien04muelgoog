in the males 10 10 20 radiating in a single series round a 0011111 dish,
the anthers oblong, nearly sessile. Ovary in the semeles of 101010
car ls connata in 1 ring round a central column dilated into a flat disk
at t etop. Styles or stigmas short or linear, free or slightly connected
in 1 ring rouu the termina] dish. Fruiting carpels closely connected
till near their maturity, separating when ripe from each other aud from
the central column and opening only alon their inner edge. Seeds of
adjoining carpels alternately p aoed near t 0 111 1111 below the to ef
