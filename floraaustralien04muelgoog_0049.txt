Verbera] xcrr. veneratorem. 37

The species is common in wapte places and pasturas in extratrepical Senth Ameriae,
end bas spread as a weed of cultivation ever south Africa, the Mauritius, and seme other
countries, and is evidently introduced only into Australis.

Tarsa 2. Vrrresnr.-Ovules amphitrepous, laterally attached above
the base or somet1mes se near the top as to appear pendulous, but the
micropyle elwa s inferior, the funicle either very short or more er less
len thened an then arising from the base of the lacento. Flowers in
amfiary or 'terminal emes er hessis, or, if selitary, en axillary er
⁸p¹fft2wdl³⁰d¹ss⁰l⁸l usually accompanred by two bracteeles besides the
su n ing rac.

ι In many of the genera ef this tribe the evary is net perlectly divided into cells, the
rneurred evulifereus margins of the carpehary leaves net meetmg in the contre at tho
time ef flowering, and the evary has in these cases bean described by Bocquillon as ene-
called with parietal placentas. The evules are, however, never placed on the inner face
of the expandedplsmntas as in Gesneriacere and other Orders vvith a normallyparietal
placentetron, an usually, after flowering, the placentae meet in the centro an unite,
or the endecarp grows and bardens so as completely te enclese each seed, forming a
fruit perfectly divided into cells, er only leaving a small oentral cavity, described by
earlier authors as a third er a fifth empty cell.

SuararanL Caeninenses—Orarynetlobed. Fruit small, dry, the
mesocnrp net succulent, the endoea t in or hard, 4·celled or mere

frequent y se arating into two Q-cel ed er four l·celled nuts, sometimes
reduced by adertion to a single l-seeded nut. Shrnbs undershrubs or
rarely herbe, usually very cottony or woelly, with branched hairs,
rarely more glabrous and glutinans or resinous. hlewers often selitary
within each braet or floral leaf, but sometimes in symes as in
Envitieeae.

The ripe seeds have been observed in afew species only, and these have shown
arather cepious albumen. This character may not, however, be constant in the sub

tribe. The ten following genera-perhaps all that strictly belong to the subtribe-are
all eudemio in Australis.
