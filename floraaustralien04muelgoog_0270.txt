1. E. australis, 811111111111111. Se. Nat. Ser. 2, ix. 195, t. 7. Stems
diffuse, rather thick, 1 to lp fr. long, glabrous as well as the whole
lant. Leaves on long tices, broa ly ovate, very obtuse, truncate or
droadly cordate at the ase, 1 to 2 in. long. Fruiting perienth very
hard, triquetrous, 4 te 5 lines long, with ³ rather long rigid thick spr-
neseent and divaricate lobes, the three inner ones short, broad, ercet,
obtuse 11 mucronate.—Miq. in Pl. Preiss. i. 6253 Meissn. in Linnoea

8. Australis. Near hdelaide end Holdt’ust Bay, F. Mueller.
W. Austrslls, Drummoud, 2nd. coll. 11. 2903 Preiss, 11. 1895.

Α common maritime plant in S. Afriee, differing slightly lrom the Mediterranesn
speeies (Ε. spinosa, Csmpd.) in the lerger lruiting perianth less rngose, the opines
eent segments longer, aud the inner ereet ones brosder end more ronnded.

2. BUMEX, Linn.

Flowers hermaphrodite or unisexual. Perianth of 6 segments, the
three inner ones enlarged after flowering and closing over the fruit,
the three outer much smaller narrow end recurved. Stamene 6.
Styles 3, shortly filiform, with large fringed stigmas. N ut triangular,
enclosed in the persistent perienth. Embrpo laterai, the rediele snpe-

rior.—Herbs or rarely, in species not Austra ian, shrnbs, usually glabrous.
Flowers small, herbaceous or the males eud-like, all often turning red,
usually on recurved pedicels, in ultori-lille clusters, either axillary or in
terminal racemes or penicles. Stipules sheathing, scarious, usually
brown, et first entire but almost always very soon torn or jegged.

A considerable genus, widely distributed over most parts of the globe, but more espe-
cially in temperate regions, and slew species are amongst the rondside weeds which
the most readily establish themselves in new countries. Ol the 8 species here enume-
rated, three are certainly and e fourth possibly introduced from Europe or South Altics,
the remaining leur appear to he endemic.

Flowers all or mostly lrcrrnaphrolite.
Inner perisntlrsegments with entire margins, one orell beur-
ing n tubercle on the midrib.
Inner periauth-segments broad, mostly cordute. Pericle
dense with shurt crowded brenches ....... 1. R. crispus.
Inner pen'snth-segments nerrew. Paniele with elongeted
branchea, tho clusters of flowers distant . . . . . . 2. Beooylemeratue.
Inner perianth-segments bonlered by long teeth.
Flower-elusters distent along the branehes, without florol
leaves except to the lower ones.
Teeth ol the rnner perisnthsegments five, with revolute
points ................ 3. Il. Brosonir'.
Teeth ol the inner perisnthssgments rigid and straight
or rurely enrved at the point ......... 4. R. pulcher.
Flornl lenves ull lon er then the flowers.
l‘snicle very 111111 divaricately branched. Clusters sev·

tubercles ............... 5. R. dammas.
