1 have not succeeded in finding any capsulas in any ol our sets ol Bexter’s or oi
Drummond¹s specimens, but es lar aa 1 cau understand the characters given, the diffe-
rence in the fruit upon which the genus Hemiclidia vas founded is merely the result ol
the abortion os one ovule, which occurs occasionally or perhaps constantly iu one or tvo
other species ol Dryaadra. The foliage arrd inflorescenoe oi D. salceta are precisaly

by the glabrous perisnthlimb.
