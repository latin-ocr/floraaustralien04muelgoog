The genus is spread ovar tha temperate regions ol tha Old World, tho Australian
speeies apparently all eudemio. 'l'he allied African and European species require, how·

applied to a Cape species, in which tlie perisnth spinos ore reduced to minute tu relos
or ura frequently quite inconspicnous and were omitted in Thnnberg's description.
Moquin, having ascertained their oooasional resonos, transferred Thunberg'a specim to
his Echinopas'ba, thet is to the section of hrown's {lochis with spineaoent parienth-

never exist. This development ol the spines is, however, so vagus in several species,
that it merus hopeless to distinguish tha two genera 1 bavo re united under 'lhunberg's
name, which is tha oldest Tha spineless speeies differ from Erwhyloeao chiefly in
tha texture of the perianth, snd in almost the whole gennetha seed is not so perleotly
flat as in Eewhylaeao sud Koohhs, the rsdicle being slightly essending or creet,
although not so much so as io b'cleroloeao.
