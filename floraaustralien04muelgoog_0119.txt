Cove, appears to me from the inspectiou ol the original specimeus to be identical wit
this plant. Brown, it is true, describes the corolla aa ahorter thau calyx aad concealed
within it and derives from that circumstance his gencric neme. But he probably had
only an imperlectly developed flower to examine. His specimens now show only
calyxes past doner, eud a few very young buda. 0. microplrylla, R. Br. l.c., from the

cent and sometimes perhaps viscid. leaves linear-terete, very obtuse,
chunnelled above, rather thiolr, contracted into a very short etiole,
crowded ou the smaller branchlets, rarely above 3 lines long. edicels
axillary, usually very short aud alwa s much ahorter than the calyx,
the bracts close under the calyx. Calyx more or less pubescent,4 or
rarel blines long, somewhet striata at the base, the lips obtuse or
shortl acuminata, nearly eual and much ahorter than the tube.

Corollh twice as long as the cdlyx, slightly pubescent or nearly glabrous,
the tube exserted‚ much enlarged upwards and incurve , the lips
short, the upper one erect, emarginate aud very broad, the lower oue

short, with ovate lobes. Stamene exserted but not exceediug the

upper lip; anthera without any appendage to the connective which is

F. Mueller onitas this and the two following species with P. microplryllo under the
name of P. cocunea, but the very marked differenoes ru the foliage as vell as ru the
shape of the corolla appear to me to be consuat in all the specimeus secu.

hoary-pubescent with short rigid heire. Leaves ver shortly petiolute,
ovato or ovate-oblong, obtuse, entire, with recurved margins hut the .
whole leaf rather incurved than recurverl, contracted at the base, rarely
under 2 lines and sometimes 4 lines lonc. Flowers axillary, nearly
sessile or on ,dicels not exceeding 1 line, the braots short, linear, close
