W. Australis, Drummoad, 3rd coll. a. 265, ath cod. a. 181; Murchison river,
Oldfield. In some herbaria, Drummond’e speciraens u. 265 are associated with othere
without flowers ol 0. integr-ischa, aad had evidently boen so transmitted by Drum-
moud, in other cases the crareapoudiug leafy specimens had been correctly sent with
the floweriug onos ol θ. iatryn'folio. I have therefore been unable to retain Meissner’s
specillo name founded upon the supposed dimorphous foliage.
