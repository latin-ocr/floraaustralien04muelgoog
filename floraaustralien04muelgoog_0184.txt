divaricately brenched scaly-tomentose scrubby slrrub, closely allied to
and perhaps e variety of A. euersa. Leaves shortly petiolute, ovete or
lanceolete, often angulas or almost hestate at thebeae, otherwise entire,
acute end under l in. long when nerrow, more obtuse and larger when
broad. Flowers semidioeoiouS, tlre mele elusters forming an interrupted
terminal spike or slightly brenched paniole, tbe semeles solitary or
nearly so in tlre axils of the upper stem-leaves in the male plant, more
numerous and often clustered when there are no males, Fruiting peri-
anth sessile, orbiculat or neerl rhomboid, ll 'to nearly 3 lines diameter,
the velves thick conver endy corky, united about half way up, the
margins entire. Seed orbicular with the radicle ascending or nearly
superior, but in many perianths tlre seed is abortive.

The specimens are insufficient to determino whether tlris is more than a variety or
state of A. cinerea. Tlre foliage however is rather different.
