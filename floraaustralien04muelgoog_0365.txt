Ver. divaricata. leaves 61161161, twice or even three times dirided into divaricata
lobes. Flowering stema shorter and the flcwors rather smaller than in the type, bnt in
the specimens the inflorescence is not yet fully developed. Τ hc stigma is 2-hcrned as
in the type—Eyre's Reliel, Marenen, and specimens lrom King George's Scund, Frater,
are apparently the same, but not in flower.
