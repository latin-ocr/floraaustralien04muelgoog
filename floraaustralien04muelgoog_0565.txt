seeds remain distinct from each other but separated from the seeds
forming two membraneus plates between the seeds, or remaining
attached to the nucleus or to the whole seed leaving the seeds separate,
each with a double or single wing-ShrubS, often low or fiowering
near the base. Leavee alternate, very rarely entire, usually either
sinuate and prickly-toothed‚ or pinnatifid or innata with numerous
small regular lobes or segmenta, usually smootlr aud reinless on the ·

usually yellow‚ the short entire base glabrous or villous towards the
divided part, the remainder of the tube or claws usually pubescant or
villone, the limb occasionally‚ the whole perianth very rarely, glabrous.
Ovary almost always hairy. Capsules usually villone, but the hairs

· The genus is eudemio in West australia. Itis readily distinguished lrom Boebeia
by tha involucra, by the flat or nearly flat receptacle, aud by the fruit3 but the structure
ol the flowere is so unilorm that it is very drfficult to establish any definite sections.
The differencea in the foliage correspoud but very little with those iu inflorescence, aud
both ure rariable in aomo speciae. Maiasner has founded hia groupsonthelormer,1
hare preferred the inflorescence, ulrich appears to rue more characteristic. With regem
to tho sections founded upon the differencee in the eocalled ‹lincopiment of the capsula
(the plata intervening between the seede),I hare adopted them rrpon tho supposition ¹
that these differences are constant, bot tlra aeede rernain to be eramined in a conside·

to their apparent allinity with those whose aeeds are known, have been misplaced, ad
