The difficulty of reducings cimeas ol' this line plant to herbarium aize is the cause
os onr inability to ascertain wileria there really is arry srrfficient character to distin nich
the three supposed species. i can lind rro differeace in, tbe flowers or fraite, aad the
leaves appear to vary, quite entire or denticulato. The llcst Μ cunt Barren specimen· ore
described by Drummond aa forming erect almost simple stonrs os 12 star rnore, with
closely pached leaves showing distinctly each year's growtlr ol 6 to 9 inclres, the lower
or earlier ones very large, the rrpper ‹rnos gradually diminisbing, and all with riehly-
coloured veina, the young oncs whitish yellow, tbe interrncdiate ones orange, turning
to a deep crimson. No such colours are described in the more common Stirliryy Range
plant, and Drummond's dried specimens bare entirely lost that which they hs .
