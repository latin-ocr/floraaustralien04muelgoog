2οω 30 or rather more carpeIS, the ovules in alternate carpels inserted
near the top or about the middle of the eavity so as to give the ap ear·
ance of biseriate cells or carpels. Styles or stigmas shortly conicnl and
soon wearing offer falling off in a ring. Fruit ohoonica or ohovoid,
much less expanded at the top and much less depressed in the eentre
than in 0. aratrum, about5 lines diameter, the carpels less distinotly
biseriate than when young, separating and dehiscent on the inner edge

mowers dioecious Perianth very open under the fruit, very shortly
and obtusely or obscurely sinuata-toothed. Stamene in the males 8 to
12 or rather more, radiatimr in a single series round a central disk;
anthers oblong, nearly sessile. Ovary of the semeles (in Τ. brevipes)
of 15 to 20 carpels completely cannete into a plurilocnlar fleshy every
not ribbed hut marked with horizontal raised eoncentric aoncs. Styles
or stigmas linear, radiating round ο broad central disk or dilated
summit of the central column. Fruit (where known) depressed glo·
bular, indehiscent‚ almost woody. Seeds oblontr, all on the same level,
with a small membraneus aril or strophiolo. 'iambryo folded. Albu-
men scanty or none-Diffnse shruhs or herbs. Leaves linear. Flowers
sessile or nearly su, the males in terminal racemes or interruptcd spikes,
the females (where known) solitery in the axils of the stem-leaves.
Bructeolcs under the perianth small.

The genus is eudemio in W. Australia.
