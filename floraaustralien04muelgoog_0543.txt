Flowers hermaphrodite. Perianth regular or nearly so, straight or
curved, the slender tube o ening equally or along the lower side only,
the limb ovoid oblong or linear, the laminae remaining long coherent,
or rarely separatio a‘s the tube opens. Anthers narrow, sessile in the

concave laminae, tire connective thick, usually very shortly produced
beyond the cells Hypogyaous scales 4, very thia aad membraneus
(rarely deficient l). Ovary very small and sessile3 style usually longer

than the periantb, rigid, curved aad rotruding from the slit in the
perianthtnbe until the end is set freelry the separation of the laminae,
aad then either straightenerl or remainin hooked or curved, rarely
straight from the first and aot exceediug alre perianth; the stigmatis
end ona level with the anthera, of a different texture but smooth, or
striate and furrowed, continuone with the style or with a prominent rim
at the base, the real stigma small and termina13 ovnles 2, collaterally
attached about the middle. Fruit a compressed capsule, openintr at

compressed, with a terminal membraneus wing broad and rounded like
the valvcs, the seeds separated by a plate of the same slrape (the con-
solidated outer inteeuments of the inner side of the two seeds) free
from the ripe secde, simple (completely consolidated) between the
nuclei, double (remaining distinct) between the win .—Trees 01·
shrubs, Leaves alternate or rarely verticillate or near y so, usually
narrow, entire toothed pinnatilid or innata, with numerous (rarely
few) short teeth lobes or segmentatis rimary veins numerous and
transverse, rarely inconspicnous or irregular and the minute reticula-
tions numerous on the under surfacc, with a minute tomentum rarely
wanting in the areolae, and sometimes white and covering the whole
under sarthae, the upper surfuce almost always glabrous and sm00th·
Flowers sessile in pairs, in dense terminal cylindrrcal oblong orglobnlar
spikes, either terminal aad sessile above the last leaves or rarelv lateral
or on short lateral branches ; each air of fiowers subtended by one
bract and two laterai rather smaller bracteolas, both bracts and

the withered remains of the perianths amongst which the capsules are
entirely concealed, or, where the tlowers are wholly decidnons, the
